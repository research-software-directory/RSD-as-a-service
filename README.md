# RSD-as-a-service

## Our mission: To promote the visibility, impact and reuse of research software

This repo contains the new RSD-as-a-service implementation

## Building

The program can easily be built with `docker-compose`:

1. Run the command `docker-compose build`. You might see an error from the service `data-migration_1`. This is intentional and is used as a workaround to only download dependencies if needed but to not start the program. The whole process itself should end successfully.

## Running locally

The program can easily be build with `docker-compose`. To run with the data migration script:

1. Run the command `docker-compose up`. As a lot of data is downloaded and processed, this can take a while (think 15 to 30 seconds).

2. After the service `data-migration_1` has exited with code `0`, you can view the data at various endpoints, e.g. http://localhost:3500/software and http://localhost:3500/project?select=_,output:mention!output_for_project(_),impact:mention!impact_for_project(\*).

To run without the data migration script:

1. Run the command `docker-compose up --scale data-migration=0`.

To run without frontend and data migration in docker-compose:

1. Run the command `docker-compose up --scale frontend=0 --scale data-migration=0`.

To clear the database (if the database structure has changed for example) before repeating the process:

1. Run the command `docker-compose down --volumes`.
