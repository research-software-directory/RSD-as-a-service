## Our mission: To promote the visibility, impact and reuse of research software

This repo contains the new RSD-as-a-service implementation

## How to build and run the RSD

### Building from source code

1. Before installing the dependencies ensure that you have Docker and docker-compose locally.
2. Set the required environment variables:
   Copy the file `.env.example` to `.env` file at the root of the project
   and fill the secrets and passwords. Check if the secrets are correct.
   The `Makefile` will take care about creating an appropriate `frontend/.env.local`
   from the `.env` file.
3. Run `make install` to install all dependencies and build the docker images.

### Running the services

```
# Start the containers via the make file
make start
# OR directly use docker-compose
docker-compose up
```

### Stopping the services

```
# Stop all services via the makefile
make down
# OR directly use docker-compose
docker-compose down
```

## Developing the frontend

You can run frontend in development mode as docker a service (called frontend-dev) that enables hot reloading. By default this frontend-dev service will not be started automatically. For more detailed instructions see [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md).

```
# Run frontend development using docker at http://localhost:3000
make frontend-docker
# OR use docker-compose directly
docker-compose up --scale frontend=0 --scale scrapers=0 --scale frontend-dev=1
```

It is possible to directly run the frontend too (without using a docker container). You must then have NodeJS installed, preferably v18.

```
# Build and install all dependencies.
make install
# Run the frontend and the documentation on localhost:3000 and localhost:3030
make dev
# Stop all services with `docker-compose down`
make down
```

More information about building and data migration can be found in [Getting started](https://research-software-directory.github.io/RSD-as-a-service/getting-started.html) documentation.
