# Adding a project

Before you can add a project, you will need have access to the RSD. See [How to get access](/users/getting-access) and [Sign in](/users/getting-access#how-to-sign-in).

After signing in, use the **"+"** button next to your avatar icon on the top right of the page, and select "New Project":

Before the project page is created, you must provide a **Title** and **Subtitle** for your project:

![image](img/new-project.gif)

The RSD will automatically generate a *slug* for your project based on the project name you have provided. This slug will become part of the URL on which your project page can found.
There is a small chance the generated slug is already in use by another project. If this is the case, an error will be show and you will need to change the slug resolve this conflict.

:::warning
After you save the project page the slug can no longer be changed! You can still change the title or subtitle of the project, however.
:::

Once you click **"save"** the RSD will initialize a new empty project page. This page will not be public yet to give you some time to provide additional information.
Next, you can add additional information in the 7 sections explained below.

## Project Information

![image](img/basic-project-information.gif)

On this page, you can add and change the basic information about the project. This includes:

- The **title** of the project
- A **subtitle** (which briefly explains the topic).
- An **image** illustrating the topic or goal of the project
- A **description** of the project (written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org)).

In addition, the sidebar on the right shows:

- The **publication status**
- A **start date** and **end date**
- A **Grant ID**
- The **funding organisation(s)** as listed in the RSD or the [ROR database](https://ror.org)
- A list of relevant **Project links** (such as a project web page, GitHub organisation, etc.)
- The **Research domain(s)** of this project (as defined by the [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/news/new-erc-panel-structure-2021-and-2022))
- **Keywords** for this project

While entering this information, any changes you make are stored automatically. You can view the resulting page by clicking **view page** in the top right corner.
Click the pencil icon in the top right to get back to the editing view.

:::tip
Choose your **Title**, **Subtitle**, **Keywords** and **Research domains** wisely, as they are used by visitors of the RSD for searching and filtering content!
:::

In the top right corner of the page, you can find a **"View page"** link, which you can use at any time to inspect the resulting project page:

![image](img/view-and-publish.gif)

The **Published** slider can be used to make the page public once you are satisfied with the result.

To return to editing the page use the ![image](img/edit-page.gif) link in the top right.

## Project Team

![image](img/project-team-information.gif)

On this page, you can add team members to the project. Using the search bar on the left, you can search for persons registered in the RSD and [ORCID](https://orcid.org) databases
using their name or ORCID. To add a team member, select the person from the drop-down list of search results, or select "Add ...." to manually add a person if no information
is found in the RSD or ORCID.

Next, a pop-up appears with the information available on this team member:

![image](img/person-information.gif)

You can correct the available information and add any missing fields before adding this person to the team. The information stored about each team member is specific to this
project. Therefore, you can safely change information about this person without having an effect on any other project the person is involved in.

:::danger
When manually adding team members or adding images or email addresses of persons, please ensure you have **permission** to share this information!
:::

## Contributing Organisations

![image](img/project-add-organisation.gif)

On this page, you can add participating organisations to the project. Using the search bar on the left, you can search for organisations listed in the RSD and [ROR](https://ror.org)
databases using their name or ROR identifier. To add a participating organisation, select the organisation from the drop-down list of search results, or select "Add ...." to
manually add an organisation if no information is found in the RSD or ROR.

Next, a pop-up appears with the information available on this organisation:

![image](img/project-add-organisation-details.gif)

The information on organisations found in the RSD or ROR database are (mostly) **read-only**. When adding a new organisation from ROR, you can only add a logo for this organisation.
All other information is retrieved automatically.

:::warning
Regular users cannot update an organisation after adding it to the RSD. Only the organisation maintainer (for registered organisations) or the RSD administrators can update this
information. Please [contact us](mailto:rsd@esciencecenter.nl) if you need to update organisation information.

## Impact and Output

![image](img/project-add-impact.gif)

In the next two sections, you can add **Impact** and **Output** to projects. These entries may consist of other research outputs such as publications, dataset, book sections, blogs, etc.
Where **Output** typically consists of research output being produced by the project team itself, **Impact** is generally triggered by events outside of the project, such as re-use of
results in other projects, publications, or society, items in the media, etc.

To add items, the search bar on the left can be used to search the RSD, [Crossref](https://crossref.org), and [DataCite](https://datacite.org) databases using the **Title** or **DOI**
of the research output. An item can be added by selecting it from the list of search results. The RSD will automatically classify the item based on the available metadata.

If needed, items without a DOI can also be added manually. After clicking **"Add"** a popup will appear to provide the details of this item.

![image](img/project-add-manual-mention.gif)

Each manually added item should at least have a **Title**, **Type** and **URL**. All other fields are optional. The **Note** field can be used to add a note to this item, and will not
be shown on the project page.

:::warning
Please check if the information is complete and correct. A manual item can not be edited after it has been saved!

## Related projects

Here you can link related project pages in the RSD to this project page. Items can be added by simply typing (part) of the name in the search and selecting the desired item from the search result list.

## Related software

This page is similar to related projects page. Here you can link related software pages in the RSD to this project. Items can be added by simply typing (part) of the software name in the search and selecting the desired item from the result list.

## Maintainers

Here, you can see all the people who can maintain this project page. You can also create invitation links to send to people you want to give maintainer access and see and delete all unused invitations.

## Publish project page

Once you are satisfied with the information you have entered for each of the sections, you can publish the software page to make it publicly available. To do so, use the **"Published"**
slider on the information page and use the **"View Project"** link to admire the result:
