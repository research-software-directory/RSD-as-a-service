However, patients with normal sleep patterns did not differ from controls while those with sleep abnormalities did (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). An identical pattern of effects were seen with the ANT response times, with the abnormality in bipolar abnormal sleepers related to the executive attentional network. Similarly, patients made fewer correct responses on the DSST compared with the controls (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). Bipolar normal sleepers did not differ while those with abnormal sleep did (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001).
